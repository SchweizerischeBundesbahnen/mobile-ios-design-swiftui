# Framework: Design System Mobile for iOS & SwiftUI

This framework contains SBB (Swiss Federal Railways) UI elements for iOS SwiftUI Apps. It allows an easy integration of SBB theming to your app (or a custom color theming of your choice). All elements are optimized for dynamic TextSizes, VoiceOver, light & dark mode as well as for different SizeClasses.
